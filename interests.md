## Interests

Medicine has always been a career focus - specifically pediatrics. Since getting involved in research at Cal Poly, I have gained a significant amount of interest in pursuing fields in Biochemistry that involve research and pharmaceutical developments. Another career that has gained my attention is a research based career in immunology. Whether or not it is medical school, a graduate degree of some sorts is one of my long term goals.
