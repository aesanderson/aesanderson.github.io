### Projects

I am Currently working on the Epoxomicin project under Dr. Katharine Watts in the Biochemistry department at Cal Poly. Specific work is assessing the functionality of two control proteins and their specific amino acids that replicate the function of our NRPS modular proteins. 
Recent experiments have included testing protein structure and function through a set of cascading enzymatic reactions and the use of optical density to analyze results. Recent experiments also include the continued development of a second assay to observe dipeptide bond formation between our two control proteins via high performance liquid chromatography.
