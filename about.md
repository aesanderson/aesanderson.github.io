### Personal Background

I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington and grew up spending time outdoors - whether it be sailing with my family, or making the trip out to the Olympic Peninsula to explore. 
I graduated from Ballard Highschool in 2020, and began my studies at Cal Poly in the fall of 2021. The learn by doing ideology held at Cal Poly was one of the many pulls that brought me to this school, and each new school year has brought a new opportunity to engage in my San Luis Obispo community educationally.
Outside of the Biochemistry field, I make it an effort to actively learn and build my understanding of ongoing current events and their relevance to the complex socioeconomic demographic of my community in Seattle, and in San Luis Obispo as well.
