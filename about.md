### Personal Background

I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington and grew up spending time outdoors - whether it be sailing with my family, or making the trip out to the Olympic Peninsula to explore. 
I graduated from Ballard Highschool in 2020, and began my studies at Cal Poly in the fall of 2021. The learn by doing ideology held at Cal Poly was one of the many pulls that brought me to this school, and each new school year has brought a new opportunity to engage in my San Luis Obispo community educationally.
Outside of the Biochemistry field, I make it an effort to actively learn and build my understanding of ongoing current events and their relevance to the complex socioeconomic demographic of my community in Seattle, and in San Luis Obispo as well. 

### Involvement at Cal Poly

Having played violin most of my life, I wanted to continue to do so in college and beyond. Cal Polyâ€™s University Symphony has given me the opportunity to continue to be involved in music. 

Currently, I am the principal second violin in the University Symphony. This position has allowed me to continue to build and develop leadership skills that will help me in the professional world, and continue to do something that has defined most of my life. 

Language Barriers are a common occurrence in all career fields in the United States - especially the medical field. The goals of a Spanish minor are to prepare properly for a culturally and linguistically diverse workforce. I also hope to complete a quarter abroad in Spain to further my language skills and experience an education system different from the one I have grown up with.
